longest substring without replacing character :



code :

def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    last_seen = {}   # char -> last index
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right, ch in enumerate(s):
        if ch in last_seen and last_seen[ch] >= left:
            left = last_seen[ch] + 1

        last_seen[ch] = right
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len

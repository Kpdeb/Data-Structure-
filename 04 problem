write a program to enter the distance of the two points and then find the distance between them :
import math
x1= float (input("enter  x1:"))
y1= float (input ("enter y2:"))

x2=float (input ("enter x2 :"))
y2 = float (input ("enter y2:"))

distance = math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)

print ("distance between the two pointer =",distance )
